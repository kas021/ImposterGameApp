## iOS App Status 🚧

**Update:**
- The iOS app was submitted to Apple, but the initial app icon/logo was rejected due to similarity with the third-party app "Among Us".
- In response, we've created a brand new logo (see above).
- Users can now freely access the **latest IPA file** before App Store upload – download directly from [IPA Release](https://github.com/kas021/ImposterGameApp/releases). Sideload, test, and play with no restrictions!

## What is Imposter?

Imposter is a thrilling social deduction game for a single device, perfect for groups of friends and family. Players receive a hidden role: either a **Civilian** (with a secret word) or the **Imposter** (who must blend in). The goal? Civilians deduce and vote out the imposters while imposters survive.

Offline play means it's great for road trips, queues, travel, or group hangouts – just pass the device and play.

## Key Features
* **Fully Offline**: Play anywhere, anytime
* **Single Device Gameplay**: Pass one phone, play with 3-12 people
* **Modern Interface**: Optimized mobile look
* **Quick Setup**: Get started in seconds
* **Strategic Play**: Deduction, bluffing, and social fun

## How to Play
1. **Setup:** Choose player count/imposters
2. **Pass the Phone:** Secretly view roles
3. **Discuss:** Share clues, deduce
4. **Vote:** Root out imposters
