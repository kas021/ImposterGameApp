## What is Imposter?

Imposter is a thrilling social deduction game designed for a single device, perfect for groups of friends and family. Players secretly receive a role: either a **Civilian** who gets a secret word, or an **Imposter** who is left in the dark. The goal? Civilians must work together to identify and vote out the imposters, while the imposters must blend in and survive.

All gameplay happens offline on one device—making it the perfect game for road trips, waiting in line, or any time you want to have fun without needing an internet connection.
